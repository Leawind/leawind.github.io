# Deaedalu

Github 仓库地址：https://github.com/modrinth/daedalus

## 简介

> Daedalus is a powerful tool which queries and generates metadata for the Minecraft (and other games in the future!) game and mod loaders for:
> 
> Performance (Serving static files can be easily cached and is extremely quick)
> Ease for Launcher Devs (Metadata is served in an easy to query and use format)
> Reliability (Provides a versioning system which ensures no breakage with updates)
> Daedalus is currently a work in progress, but will support the original Minecraft data and reposting for all Forge and Fabric artifacts.
> 
> Once Daedalus is done, Modrinth will provide full documentation for how to query from it and use it for your own launcher!
