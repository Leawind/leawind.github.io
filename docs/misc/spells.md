| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pronunciation** | Various, including: AK-ee-oh, AK-see-oh, AS-see-oh (US), and AT-chee-oh (Anglo-Catholic pronunciation) |

### Description

Summons an object towards the caster. It is able to summon objects in direct line of sight of the caster, as well as things out of view, by calling the object aloud after the incantation (unless the spell is cast nonverbally). This spell needs thought behind it, and the object must be clear in the caster's mind before trying to summon it. The caster doesn't necessarily need to know the location of the target as long as they say the name of the object to be summoned, such as when Hermione Granger summoned some books from Dumbledore's office simply by saying "Accio Horcrux books!" while in Gryffindor Tower .

### Seen/Mentioned

Harry Potter summoned his broom to complete the first task of the Triwizard Tournament in 1994 , and to summon the Portkey to escape Voldemort and the Death Eaters in the Little Hangleton graveyard in 1995 . Also, in the Battle of the Seven Potters Harry summoned Hagrid when he fell. Molly Weasley used it to get the twins ' candy. The twins used it to summon their brooms from Dolores Umbridge 's office

### Etymology

The Latin word accio means "I call" or "I summon".

### Notes

-   The Summoning Charm is unable to directly summon exceptionally large targets such as buildings, or living creatures (except for Flobberworms which aren't considered to be worth summoning). It is also unable to summon Horcruxes as they have protective enchantments placed on them. It is, however, possible to move a creature by summoning things they are wearing or holding. It is also possible to bewitch items to become unaffected from this charm, as is the case with most bought goods.

Amato is a conjugation of the Latin word amo, which means "I love" or "I am obliged to". Animo and animato are both different conjugations of the Latin word animo, which can mean "I animate" or "I fill with breath or life".

### Description

Seamlessly repairs broken objects.

### Seen/Mentioned

Used by Albus Dumbledore and Horace Slughorn to repair damage the latter had done to a Muggle home in Budleigh Babberton where he had been hiding. It was also used by Harry Potter to repair his wand with the Elder Wand

### Etymology

Latin reparo meaning "to renew" or "repair".

### Notes

-   Reparo has been seen to repair non -magical items, however it seems to have an inability at repairing magical items or items that have magic placed upon them. An example is Harry's Nimbus 2000 shown in 1993 which he is told is irreparable after it is destroyed by the Whomping Willow. Wands are also irreparable, as shown in 1992 when Ron's wand snapped after he and Harry crashed onto the Hogwarts grounds. Despite his use of Spellotape, Ron's wand malfunctioned throughout the year. Another example is in 1997 when Hermione tried to fix Harry's broken wand, which was snapped by her errant Blasting Curse. However, Harry repaired his wand with the Elder Wand. Since the Elder Wand is the most powerful wand in creation, it makes sense that it would produce the most powerful Mending Charm.

## Repello Inimicum

| **Type**          | Charm                      |

## Revelio (Revelio Charm)

| **Pronunciation** | reh-VEL-ee-oh |

## Rictusempra (Tickling Charm)

| **Type**          | Charm            |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| **Pronunciation** | ric-tuhs-SEM-pra |

### Description

Tickles the target until they become weak with laughter.

### Seen/Mentioned

By Harry Potter on Draco Malfoy in 1992 , when they fought in the Duelling Club .

### Etymology

Possibly the sum of two words; The Latin rictus , meaning "The expanse of an open mouth", and semper , meaning "Always". Rictus is generally used as an expression of terror, however, "always an open mouth" would, in most cases, correspond to the act of laughing uncontrollably.

## Riddikulus (Boggart Banishing Spell)

| **Type**          | Charm           |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| **Pronunciation** | rih-dih-KUL-lus |

### Description

A spell used when fighting a Boggart , "Riddikulus" forces the Boggart to take the appearance of an object the caster is focusing on. Best results can be achieved if the caster is focusing on something humorous, with the desire that laughter will weaken the Boggart.

### Seen/Mentioned

Taught by Remus Lupin during third year Defence Against the Dark Arts , where his students had the opportunity to practise the spell on an actual Boggart .

### Etymology

Latin word ridiculus , "laughable" (but perhaps "absurd" or "silly" in this context).

### Notes

-   The effect of the spell seems to rely primarily on the state of mind of the caster. It doesn't actually change the shape of a boggart into something humorous, but rather whatever the caster is concentrating on at the moment of the casting, as when Neville was thinking of his grandmother's dress. Presumably, Mrs Weasley couldn't take her mind off of her fears for her family, so the Boggart was changed into other members of the family rather than something humorous.

## Salvio hexia

| **Type**          | Charm                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Pronunciation** | SAL-vee-oh HECKS-ee-ah |

### Description

Protects against hexes .

### Etymology

Possibly derived from the Latin "salveo," meaning "to be in good health," and used as a form of greeting and farewell, and a pseudo-Latin derivative of the English word "hex"—hence, "Farewell, hexes!"

### Seen/Mentioned

Harry and Hermione cast this spell to strengthen their camp-site's defences against intruders in 1997 .

### Notes

-   Possibly the Hex Deflection spells the fake Moody mentioned in 1994.

## Scourgify (Scouring Charm)

| **Type**          | Charm      |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| **Pronunciation** | SKUR-ji-fy |

### Description

Cleans objects

### Seen/Mentioned

First used by Nymphadora Tonks to clean Hedwig 's cage in 1995 . Later, Ginny Weasley performed the spell to clean up the Stinksap on the Hogwarts Express , also used by James Potter on Severus Snape after he shouted various curses and obscenities at him.

### Etymology

Perhaps related to English scour , "clean". -ify is a common English suffix meaning "to make ...". Therefore scourgify could mean "to make clean".

## Sectumsempra

| **Type**          | Curse            |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| **Pronunciation** | sec-tum-SEMP-rah |

### Description

Lacerates the target, as if they have been "slashed by a sword." Subsequently, the target can easily bleed to death from the wounds. This curse was invented by Severus Snape , to be used against his personal enemies.

### Seen/Mentioned

Used by Harry in 1997 against Draco Malfoy , and then later against both the Inferi in Lord Voldemort 's Horcrux cave, and Snape used it against George Weasley (was unintentional; aimed for a Death Eater that tried to curse Lupin) in the Order's flight from Privet Drive. Harry learned it in Snape's old Potions textbook. In 1998 , the spell is said to be Severus Snape 's "signature" spell.

### Etymology

Latin sectum , "cut", and semper , "always".

### Notes

-   The spell can apparently be used against any object, but was not effective when used against Inferi because they could not feel pain or bleed. The movement of the wand seems to affect how someone is cut, suggested by the erratic patterns of slashes left on Draco Malfoy 's face and chest, produced by Harry Potter 's wild wand-swings while using the spell against Draco. Wounds caused by this spell can be healed as proved by Severus Snape who after Harry hit Draco Malfoy with this spell he healed Draco's wounds and told him to go and get treated with dittany at once so that he would even avoid any sign of any wound. However it seems that it depends on the caster's magical abilities because Molly Weasley could not heal and restore George Weasley's ear that was cursed off by this spell.

### Seen/Mentioned

Often; particularly by a number of wizards and witches (including Dolores Umbridge) against Minerva McGonagall in 1996 . It's also taught by Harry in his D.A. meetings.

### Etymology

English stupefy , which means 'to put into a stupor', a temporary vegetative state.

### Notes

-   The physical manifestation of the spell is a beam of red light emanating from the caster's wand. The spell wears off after a short time, and can be countered by Rennervate . Nearly useless on magic-resistant creatures such as dragons, trolls and giants unless more than one Stupefy spell is used at the same time. The force of the spell is additive or perhaps even exponential, and it can cause severe injury if many spells are used on a target that is not normally resistant to its effects. Hagrid, as a half-giant, was impervious to this spell - or at least, a lone one.

### Etymology

Surgito is a Latin word in the imperative form meaning "you/he/she shall arise, or get up", and is a conjugation of the verb surgo ("I arise"). The etymology is appropriate, considering that the effects of the spell on Jacob Kowalski can be likened to waking up from a confused, dreamlike state.
